# cd-wordpress
continuous deployment wordpress

TLDR;

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will continuously deploy on gh-pages using the [diy-pwa/npm-build-2-gh-pages@v1.11](https://github.com/diy-pwa/npm-build-2-gh-pages) plugin. You can also deploy on a cloud provider by running `npm run build`. Your static site will be in the `dist/` folder.

The idea of this is as a consumer of microfrontends. There is an example microfrontend for [paypal standard](https://github.com/diy-pwa/paypal-microfrontend) here.

Have fun composing work from autonomous teams.

# UX308 Lab 6

## Browser Environment - PWA

I (@rhildred) have been working on a system to make a progressive web app with wordpress. In this assignment you will produce a wordpress site, using wordpress, and publish it on github pages.

The website should be about the same thing as your Assignment 1 with 3 posts or landing pages they can find by googling. You will also need an about page to give context for your post.

You will need to have the products you are selling with your bot in the site as well. You can add some extras too.

We will publish these sites on github pages together and build on this next week for assignment 2.
